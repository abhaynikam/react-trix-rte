React Trix rich text editor is react wrapper built for the Trix editor created by [Basecamp](https://trix-editor.org/). We have built this library because we were rewriting the same component in multiple project.

This wrapper uses React hooks and adds readable event listeners on the Trix editor. The library also adds two toolbar components which has the ability to customize the toolbar actions as per our need.

### Demo

Please see the some live example on [ReactTrixRTE-Storybook](https://abhaynikam.github.io/react-trix-rte)

### Installation

To install the React Trix RTE, run the following command in the console.

```
npm install react-trix-rte
OR
yarn add react-trix-rte
```

### Usage

```javascript
import Trix from "trix";
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { ReactTrixRTEInput } from "react-trix-rte";

export default function TrixEditor(props) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");

  function handleChange(event, newValue) {
    setValue(newValue); // OR custom on change listener.
  }

  return (
    <ReactTrixRTEInput
      defaultValue="<div>React Trix Rich Text Editor</div>"
      onChange={handleChange}
    />
  )
}
```

### Upgrading to 1.0.7 or higher
React Trix RTE version `1.0.7` removes the dependency import for Trix because using Trix outside directly causes problems. Read issue: [17](https://github.com/abhaynikam/react-trix-rte/issues/17) and [19](https://github.com/abhaynikam/react-trix-rte/pull/19).

Import `import Trix from "trix";` to the component using React Trix RTE.

### ReactTrixInput API

`ReactTrixInput` is the Trix editor input which by default comes with the toolbar. The `ReactTrixInput` comes with following properties that could be accepted.

| Name                | Type | Description |

| name                | string   | The HTML name attribute for the input field

| className           | string | Apply a custom css class to the editor |
| trixInputRef        | function | Adds a custom ref to the React Trix Input to programmatically edit text. Read the documentation for manual things you can perform on Trix editor [here](https://github.com/basecamp/trix#editing-text-programmatically) |
| onBeforeInitialize  | function | Fires when the `<trix-editor>` element is attached to the DOM just before Trix installs its editor object. |
| onInitialize        | function | Fires when the `<trix-editor>` element is attached to the DOM and its editor object is ready for use. |
| onChange            | function | Fires whenever the editor’s contents have changed. |
| onSelectionChange   | function | Fires any time the selected range changes in the editor. |

| onAttachmentAdd     | function | Fires after an attachment is added to the document. You can access the Trix attachment object through the attachment property on the event. If the attachment object has a file property, you should store this file remotely and set the attachment’s URL attribute. See the attachment example for detailed information. |

### ReactTrixRTEToolbar API

`ReactTrixRTEToolbar` is the custom Trix editor toolbar component. This component helps in customizing the toolbar options, classes and attributes in better way.

| toolbarActions        | array    | Allows customizing the list of toolbar actions. The available actions are `["bold", "italic", "strike", "link", "heading1", "quote", "code", "bullet", "number", "outdent", "indent", "attachFiles", "undo", "redo"]`.  |
| customToolbarActions  | object   | Override the toolbar actions properties or add custom toolbar actions. You can refer to default [toolbar actions options](https://github.com/abhaynikam/react-trix-rte/blob/master/src/components/ReactTrixRTEToolbar/constants.js) |

### Custom Toolbar Usage

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Trix from "trix";

export default function TrixEditor(props) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");

  function handleChange(event, newValue) {
    setValue(newValue); // OR custom on change listener.
  }

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <ReactTrixRTEToolbar toolbarId="react-trix-rte-editor" />
      <ReactTrixRTEInput
        toolbarId="react-trix-rte-editor"
        defaultValue="<div>React Trix Rich Text Editor</div>"
        onChange={handleChange}
      />
